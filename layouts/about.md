### Make Your Own Music
Making music on the guitar doesn't have to be hard. You don't need to memorize theory. You don't need to trudge through painful grimoires or methods. You don't even need to read music. All you need to do is grab your guitar, play it, and try to hold on to the good stuff. 

So, do the books, theories, and methods hold any value? Of course they do! But you're free to choose, so why not just cherry-pick the good stuff and roll your own?
